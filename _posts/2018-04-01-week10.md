## What did you do this past week?
I built a [K-means][kmeans] solver that runs on the GPU using [CUDA][CUDA], which is a C++ library for NVidia GPU computation. GPU K-means was the fourth project for Concurrency and at this point I'm pretty familiar with k-means, writing testing scripts, and parallelizing things in general. The idea behind this project was to rebuild the k-means algorithm that we had parallelized previously on the CPU, this time using CUDA. Ultimately, I was able to get 20x-80x speedup (wow!) over the single-threaded solution, versus about 4x-8x speedup with a parallel CPU solution.

Kendall and I also started working on the design of the Darwin project. It did take us some time to come up with a system of communication that avoided monolithic classes while preventing dependency inversions and avoiding exposing implementation details. We wrote out some UML using [PlantUML][plantuml], which I found to have a pretty intuitive syntax. Plus, you can build it into a PDF automatically using the Java-based PlantUML compiler.

## What's in your way?
We only have a few days to do Darwin, but I'm confident that we'll be alright.

## What will you do next week?
1. Darwin!
2. Maintain a better sleep schedule

## What's my experience of the class?
Just when I thought that I really knew what was going on, I learned about the rvalue reference. I'm impressed by how thoroughly the C++ vector addresses the mechanics of what vectors do, and how's it's able to be as efficient and flexible as possible. I am starting to get the sense that it is much easier to write working C++ code than it is to write good C++ code, maybe more so than in other languages. Hopefully everyone who writes C++ is as careful as the authors of the STL.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
[Valgrind][valgrind] is the best memory error checker.

April fools! I would highly recommend checking out [AddressSanitizer][asan] instead. While it requires you to recompile your program, it is a much more powerful tool for debugging that is great when you're doing something wrong and really don't know what it is. I was struggling with rewriting my k-means solver for the GPU using heap allocation instead of vectors (no vectors on the GPU, sorry) and while Valgrind detected the presence of an error, AddressSanitizer was more helpful in showing me what it was and where I allocated the memory:

AddressSanitizer is now included in `clang++` and `g++`. Compiling your program with AddressSanitizer is as simple as adding the flags `-fsanitize=address` and `-lasan`. I'd highly suggest you try it sometime.
