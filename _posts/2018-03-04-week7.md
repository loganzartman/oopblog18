## What did you do this past week?
I split this week between finishing my third lab for Concurrency and studying for the OOP exam before having the chance to attend an onsite interview on Friday. The third Concurrency lab was about using [Go][golang] to compare binary search trees. Essentially, two trees are equal if their [in-order traversal][iot] is the same. Before comparing two trees, it can be cheaper to [hash][hash] them and skip the comparison if the hashes aren't equal. This was my first experience with Go and I found it to be pretty interesting as a language. It's [very easy][goroutines] to run things in parallel, and there are [cool language features][select] for dealing with concurrency. My biggest complaint is that uncontrollable garbage collection can complicate high performance code. 

## What's in your way?
Not much this week. I'm excited for spring break and still not 100% sure what I'm doing.

## What will you do next week?
1. Look for a partner for Allocator!
2. Read about Allocator
3. Think about starting Allocator

## What's my experience of the class?
The test was pretty much what I expected from my experience in [SWE][blog that no one read]. I really wasn't sure what questions would be on it, and I kind of expected to be using a bit of transform/accumulate. Nonetheless, I felt prepared without doing the traditional cram session. The questions corresponded very closely to material that was directly covered in lecture, and I felt that the test was fair overall.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
This is not my flashiest tip of the week and might seem obvious, but: skip hard questions. One of the most universal test-taking strategies is to solve what you can and immediately skip things that you are unsure of. There are some [studies][creativity] supporting the idea that the brain can do creative problem solving subconsciously, while you are doing other things. During the OOP exam, I for some reason had absolutely no idea how to do the second problem, so after staring at it for a couple minutes I decided to do it last. By the end of the exam, for whatever reason, I had less trouble with it.
